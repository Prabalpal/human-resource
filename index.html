            <p>Published on December 4, 2023</p>
            <p>Climate Change: A Looming Threat, a Call to Action
                Climate change is the defining challenge of our generation. It's the long-term shift in weather patterns and temperatures that is already impacting our planet, with devastating consequences. From melting glaciers and rising sea levels to extreme weather events and unpredictable seasons, the effects are undeniable.
                The science is clear: human activities, primarily the burning of fossil fuels, are releasing greenhouse gases into the atmosphere. These gases trap heat, causing the planet to warm. The consequences are far-reaching and interconnected, impacting ecosystems, economies, and human health.
                Here are some of the most pressing concerns:
                •	Rising sea levels: Melting glaciers and thermal expansion of the oceans are causing sea levels to rise, threatening coastal communities and low-lying islands.
                •	Extreme weather events: Climate change is intensifying storms, heatwaves, droughts, and floods, leading to widespread damage, displacement, and loss of life.
                •	Loss of biodiversity: Rising temperatures and changing habitats are pushing many plant and animal species towards extinction, disrupting ecosystems and threatening food security.
                •	Water scarcity: Changes in precipitation patterns and increased evaporation are leading to water scarcity in many regions, impacting agriculture, sanitation, and human health.
                •	Public health risks: Climate change is exacerbating air pollution, increasing the risk of respiratory illnesses, heatstroke, and other health problems.
                The good news is that it's not too late to act. We can still mitigate the worst effects of climate change and build a more sustainable future.
                Here are some key actions we can take:
                •	Transition to renewable energy sources: Solar, wind, geothermal, and other renewable energy sources can power our homes, businesses, and transportation without emitting greenhouse gases.
                •	Improve energy efficiency: Reducing our energy consumption through smarter appliances, better insulation, and sustainable practices can significantly cut emissions.
                •	Protect forests and natural ecosystems: Forests act as carbon sinks, absorbing CO2 from the atmosphere. We need to conserve existing forests and plant new ones to mitigate climate change.
                •	Adopt sustainable agriculture practices: Regenerative farming techniques, such as crop rotation and cover crops, can improve soil health, increase carbon sequestration, and reduce reliance on chemical fertilizers.

            <h2 class="politics-news">Manipur</h2>
            <p>Published on December 3, 2023</p>
            <p>Manipur witnessed fresh violence in a series of violent incidences that has gripped the state since May, 2023. According to media reports citing officials, 13 people were killed in a gunfight between two groups of militants in Manipur's Tengnoupal district. The incident took place at Leithu village on Monday afternoon, PTI reported.
                "A group of militants on their way to Myanmar were ambushed by another group of insurgents dominant in the area," an official in the hill district told PTI. 
                Security forces reaching the spot found 13 bodies so far, he said, adding their identities were yet to be ascertained but they appeared not to be locals.
                The officer said that it appeared the dead are not from Leithu area and could have come from another place after which they engaged in a firefight with a separate group, Hindustan Times reported. 
                Notably, Tengnoupal district shares a porous border with Myanmar.
                Manipur administration in Manipur has repeatedly mentioned the nuisance of anti-social elements in border areas with Myanmar. 
                Mobile Internet Restored in Manipur
                Meanwhile, the Manipur government on Sunday restored mobile internet services across the state barring a few areas till 18 December, a notification said.
                "Considering improvement in law and order and inconveniences faced by people due to the mobile internet ban, the state government has decided to relax the suspension," the notification said.
                Mobile towers catering to services within a 2km radius along adjoining areas between districts such as Chandel and Kakching, Churachandpur and Bishnupur, Churachandpur and Kakching, Kangpokpi and Imphal West, Kangpokpi and Imphal East, Kangpokpi and Thoubal and Tengnoupal and Kakching will still face suspended operations, it said.
                
                Mobile internet had been suspended in the state since May 3 following the outbreak of violence in the state.
                Kuki Zo Community Demand Separate Administration
                Last week, in several areas of Manipur, members of the Kuki Zo community demonstrated on streets demanding a separate administration. They urged the Centre to hasten the process of establishing a separate administration in areas of the state dominated by the Kuki Zo community.
                The agitators submitted a memorandum to Union Home Minister Amit Shah through the deputy commissioner.
                Zo United accused the state government, including the police, of aligning with the Meiteis, and distributing government-issued firearms to members of the valley-based community for use against the tribals.
                More than 180 people have been killed and thousands rendered homeless in ongoing ethnic strife between Imphal Valley-based Meiteis and hills-based Kuki Zo community in Manipur since May 3 this year.

            <p>Published on December 2, 2023</p>
            <p>Mount Marapi on the island of Sumatra, erupted on Sunday, spewing an ash tower 3,000 metres into the sky that rained volcanic debris onto nearby villages
                December 04, 2023 09:14 am | Updated 09:14 am IST - Padang, Indonesia
                
                At least 11 hikers were found dead and three others were rescued by search teams that worked through the night to find people missing after the eruption of a volcano in western Indonesia, officials said Monday.
                Mount Marapi on the island of Sumatra, with a peak of 2,891 (9,484 feet) metres erupted on Sunday, spewing an ash tower 3,000 metres into the sky that rained volcanic debris onto nearby villages.
                Officials from local and national agencies revised up the number of hikers on the mountain over the weekend to 75, but search teams found the 11 dead near the crater on Monday morning.
                "There are 26 people who have not been evacuated, we have found 14 of them, three were found alive and 11 were found dead," said Abdul Malik, head of Padang Search and Rescue Agency, speaking a day after the eruption.

                At least 11 hikers were found dead and three others were rescued by search teams that worked through the night to find people missing after the eruption of a volcano in western Indonesia, officials said Monday.
                Mount Marapi on the island of Sumatra, with a peak of 2,891 (9,484 feet) metres erupted on Sunday, spewing an ash tower 3,000 metres into the sky that rained volcanic debris onto nearby villages.
                Officials from local and national agencies revised up the number of hikers on the mountain over the weekend to 75, but search teams found the 11 dead near the crater on Monday morning.
                "There are 26 people who have not been evacuated, we have found 14 of them, three were found alive and 11 were found dead," said Abdul Malik, head of Padang Search and Rescue Agency, speaking a day after the eruption.
                Twelve were still missing and 49 had descended the mountain, some who were taken to hospital, he said.
                The three survivors were found near the crater and "their condition was weak, and some had burns," said the official.
                Rescue workers were taking turns carrying the dead down the mountain due to the arduous terrain.
                A clip shared with AFP by rescue teams at the scene showed an ambulance blaring its sirens, rushing an evacuated climber from the scene with burns.
                In another clip, a rescue worker with a flashlight strapped to his head, piggybacks a hiker who moans in pain and says "God is great" as she is led to safety in the darkness of night.
                The eruption was ongoing, which was preventing air evacuations by helicopter, Mr Malik said.
                "Visually, until this morning, smokes are still billowing from the top. Visually, everything still looks grey," he said.
                Raining ash
                Rudy Rinaldi, head of the West Sumatra Disaster Mitigation Agency, told AFP some of the rescued hikers needed medical treatment because of their proximity to the eruption.
                "Some suffered from burns because it was very hot, and they have been taken to the hospital," he said.
                "Those who are injured were the ones who got closer to the crater."
                According to a national search and rescue agency, or Basarnas, list seen by AFP of those found, at least eight people suffered burns, one had burns and a fracture and another had a head wound.
                Ahmad Rifandi, an official at the Mount Marapi monitoring station, told AFP that ash rain was observed after the eruption.
                "It has reached to Bukittinggi city," he said Sunday, referring to the third-largest city in West Sumatra that has a population of more than 100,000.
                Local disaster agency official Ade Setiawan said in a statement residents in local villages were "given masks and reminded to stay inside their houses".
                Marapi is on the second alert level of Indonesia's four-step system and authorities have imposed a three-kilometre exclusion zone around its crater.
                The Indonesian archipelago sits on the Pacific Ring of Fire, where the meeting of continental plates causes high volcanic and seismic activity.
                The Southeast Asian country has nearly 130 active volcanoes.

            <h2 class="sports-news">Decoding India’s 7.6% GDP</h2>
            <p>Published on December 1, 2023</p>
            <p>Today’s Finshots, we break down some aspects of India’s amazing economic growth for July to September 2023.
                But before we begin, if you're someone who loves to keep tabs on what's happening in the world of business and finance, then hit subscribe if you haven't already. If you’re already a subscriber or you’re reading this on the app, you can just go ahead and read the story.
                ________________________________________
                The Story
                At first glance, the headline 7.6% GDP growth is spectacular. We’ve surpassed all expectations. And there’s ample reason to celebrate. Especially since the rest of the world is struggling a tad bit.
                But there's a lot hiding behind the data. So let's look at the GDP growth figure in a little more detail.
                Now the first thing you’ll notice is that the Manufacturing sector has grown by a whopping 13.9%! This segment primarily consists of factory activity. It involves folks that make apparel and textiles, petroleum products, office machinery and a whole host of other similar stuff. So when you see manufacturing picking up, it’s a happy moment. You believe that the factories are running at full tilt because the demand for goods is soaring and they’re producing what’s needed.
                This growth has surpassed all expectations and has been a primary driver in pushing the country's GDP. However, it's important to look at the 13.9% figure with some added context. If you look closely, you’ll see that the manufacturing sector actually sputtered during the same period last year. It fell by -3.8% and lost value. As T N Ninan from Business Standard pointed out, that means today’s manufacturing growth looks good because it’s come on the back of a low base. Or put another way, say during July to September of 2021, the value of manufacturing activity was 100. During the same period next year, it fell by 3.8% to 96.2. Now while the the sector has grown by 13.8% during the next year, the overall value is still only 109.5. Basically, manufacturing has indeed grown in the last couple of years, but perhaps the headline number doesn't capture all the details.
                We can also look at another metric known as the Index of Industrial Production or IIP to get a better understanding. It calculates the value of manufacturing activity too. This is what we call a high-frequency indicator since it’s released monthly. And it kind of reveals the same thing. There's increased activity when compared to last year, however, manufacturing companies haven't been producing as much stuff in the last few months.
                Should we be concerned?
                Well, it's hard to say for sure. Because factories will only feel emboldened to produce more goods if there’s demand from people like you and me. We need to open our purse strings and spend at the end of the day. So, the question is — what’s happening on the expenditure side? Are people spending or are they cautious?
                Well, let's look at another number. The government calculates something called the ‘Private Final Consumption Expenditure’ during the GDP exercise. Think of this as the money that people like you and me actually spend in the economy. And this has grown by 3.5% over the past year. That's still growth. However, this comes with a caveat. If you’ve been reading Finshots, you’ll remember that we’ve written a couple of stories about the rise of unsecured personal loans in the country (here and here). People have been borrowing money to spend. So some experts believe that the growth in private expenditure could be attributed to the loans. And now that the RBI is trying to turn the tap off on these loans, could consumption actually take a tumble? We hope not.
                The other thing here is that the agriculture sector hasn't contributed to the GDP growth a lot. If you look at the GDP data, you’ll see that it has grown only by 1.2% in the past year. That could be a dampener for rural income. In fact, if you listen to what FMCG companies such as Britannia and Marico have to say, they’re all concerned about a slowdown in the rural segment.
                And here’s the crux of the problem - Consumption drives 60% of the value of our GDP. And if this engine isn’t firing as expected, it will eventually be a drag on growth. The only way out then is for the government to spend money instead. Try and keep building stuff like roads and bridges in the hope that it will create jobs and people will spend money. But you and I know that it’s not a long-term solution. The government might need to resort to borrowing money to fulfil this obligation. At some point, that will have to end. So we need both household and private sector spending to do some of the heavy lifting too.
                So yeah, in a nutshell — India is growing. But there are some hurdles along the way. And if we can iron that out, we could keep this momentum going. And hopefully, we’ll get to the mark of being a $5 trillion economy sooner rather than later.
                Until then...

            <h2 class="entertainment-news">WWE 2023</h2>
            <p>Published on November 30, 2023</p>
            <p>WWE 2023: A Universe Divided Between Legacy and EvolutionThe year is 2023, and the WWE stands at a crossroads. The global juggernaut of professional wrestling, once synonymous with the Attitude Era's rebellious spirit and larger-than-life characters, finds itself navigating a landscape shaped by evolving fan preferences, a changing media landscape, and the ever-present shadow of its own legendary past.Gone are the days of Stone Cold Steve Austin's middle fingers and The Rock's electrifying promos. Today's WWE operates in a different stratosphere. Social media reigns supreme, attention spans dwindle, and the competition for eyeballs is fiercer than ever. Yet, amidst this flux, the essence of professional wrestling – the ability to captivate, enthrall, and evoke emotion – remains constant.Roman Reigns: The Undisputed Era of "The Tribal Chief"Roman Reigns, the current Undisputed WWE Universal Champion, embodies this dichotomy. Clad in a head lei and wielding a ceremonial spear, he leads his Anoa'i family dynasty – The Bloodline – with an air of regal dominance. His on-screen persona, "The Tribal Chief," is a far cry from the underdog babyface he once was. He's ruthless, calculating, and unapologetically powerful. His reign, though criticized by some for its predictability, has solidified him as a dominant force in the industry.The New Guard: Becky Lynch, Seth Rollins, and the NXT AlumniBut the landscape is far from monolithic. Becky Lynch, "The Man," continues to blaze a trail for women's wrestling. From main-eventing WrestleMania to leading a locker room revolution, her influence is undeniable. Seth Rollins, the ever-evolving "Visionary," showcases his in-ring acumen and storytelling prowess, while NXT alumni like Bianca Belair ("The EST of WWE") and Bron Breakker ("The Monster") inject fresh energy and athleticism into the main roster.NXT: A Breeding Ground for the FutureNXT, once the black-and-gold haven of pure athleticism, has undergone a metamorphosis. Now led by the enigmatic Grayson Waller, it's a platform for edgy characters, unpredictable storylines, and a focus on sports entertainment over pure wrestling. This shift has drawn criticism from purists, but it's undeniable that NXT continues to be a breeding ground for future stars like Solo Sikoa and Mandy Rose, who are slowly making their mark on the main roster.Beyond the In-Ring Action: Reality TV, Social Media, and the Global ReachThe WWE's reach extends far beyond the squared circle. Reality TV shows like Total Bellas and Miz & Mrs. allow fans a glimpse into the Superstars' "real" lives, blurring the lines between fiction and reality. Social media fuels instant engagement and fan interaction, with wrestlers like Bayley and Sami Zayn becoming masters of the platform. Live events are no longer restricted to arenas; WWE Superstars travel the globe, performing in Saudi Arabia, the United Kingdom, and beyond, cementing the company's status as a true global phenomenon.The Legacy Looms LargeYet, the specter of the Attitude Era continues to haunt the present. Fans reminisce about Austin's beer blasts and The Rock's catchphrases, yearning for a return to a simpler, more rebellious time. Promos feel scripted, characters lack authenticity, and storylines struggle to capture the same rawness that once defined the WWE.Can the WWE Have It All?The question facing the WWE in 2023 is this: can it reconcile its legacy with its evolution? Can it cater to the nostalgia-hungry fans while simultaneously forging a path for the future? The answer, perhaps, lies in embracing the duality. Acknowledging the Attitude Era's influence while carving a distinct identity for the present. Showcasing the athletic prowess of the new guard while understanding the power of storytelling and larger-than-life personas.The WWE of 2023 is a universe divided. A place where Roman Reigns reigns supreme, Becky Lynch breaks barriers, and Grayson Waller pushes boundaries. It's a world grappling with its past, embracing its present, and cautiously stepping into an uncertain future. Whether it can recapture the magic of eras past or forge its own legacy remains to be seen. But one thing is certain: the WWE, with its captivating blend of athleticism, drama, and spectacle, will continue to enthrall audiences and evolve with the ever-changing landscape of entertainment.So, grab your popcorn, silence your notifications, and prepare to be entertained. Because the WWE, in 2023 and beyond, promises one thing: it will never be boring.
